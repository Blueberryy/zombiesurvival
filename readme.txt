THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL MODIFICATION OF THE ORIGINAL ZOMBIE SURVIVAL BY JETBOOM.

Over the years I kept on getting countless requests to rebuild and bring 
back to what was known as the "Bandit System". 
The bandit system is where upon redeeming the client is greeted 
with the option which they can choose to stay as
a bandit (which can help or kill humans) or change back into a human.

Current Version - Stable 4 "The Translation System V2" - https://github.com/MrCraigTunstall/zombiesurvival/releases
Here is the current list of updates, fixes and additional features:

- Basic Redeem System.
- Complete Russian & German Language Translation.
- Spectator system with the option in the F1 menu.
- Altered how dropped deployable items work.
- Worth & in-game pointshop are now bigger.
- Re-balance weapon and item pricing.
- HD Texture icons.
- Healthbars on Resupply & Arsenal Crates.
- Humans and Bandits can use third person.
- Zombie Class Menu now has the Boss Button centered and is much bigger.
- Fixed when another server alters the waves logic (even though they certainly shouldn't).
- Built-in Spray Detector.
- Discount Prices are shown during wave intermissions.
- Fixed an point exploit with skycade props.
- Improved Zombie Class Unlock Infliction Percentage.
- Melee weapons no longer "water splash".
- Fixed prop holding position with doors etc.
- Improved Healthbar FPS.
- Disabled MouthMoveAnimation.
- Bandits Flash on the Scoreboard.
- New Beats.

1. Get srcds and configure it for garrysmod (requires steamcmd).
2. Put the zombiesurvival folder in garrysmod/gamemodes with all the other gamemode folders.
3. Get some maps. ZS_ maps are plentiful on the Internet and the game also supports many other map types: CS:S, Zombie Mod, Zombie Horde, Zombie Panic! Source
4. Either setup a custom voting script or use mapcycle_zombiesurvival.txt. Make a file called mapcycle_zombiesurvival.txt in base garrysmod folder. Put in names of maps without the .bsp ending. One per line.
5. Make your auto-start batch file or whatever you use. The line should look like this:
srcds.exe -port 27015 -console -game garrysmod -secure +ip 24.102.103.104 +hostport 27015 +gamemode zombiesurvival +maxplayers 32 +map zs_oldhouse +hostname "Your ZS Server"
6. Run it. You now have a server. See other guides on the web for setting up sv_downloadurl.
